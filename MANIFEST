-------
9a.
I added a text-shadow to the .page-title css styling to make my title "Chanyu's About Me" cooler looking.
    text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
9b.
I added clamping on the texts which scales the text size of my .about-content section from 14px to 25px depending on the size of my view window.
    font-size: clamp(14px, 2vw, 25px);

12. a,b,c
(a) I created a linear gradient on the background color of the header element from yellow to blue.
    background: linear-gradient(to right, #fffb09, var(--text-color));

(b,c) I also made the .project cards lift slightly when hovered and added a bit of shadows on the bottom.
    transform: translateY(-5px);
    box-shadow: 0 12px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);

18. b
(b) I crated an inline svg icon of a computer to put in my about-content section after the text "CS"
    svg class="icon-computer" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="currentColor" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"

JAVASCRIPT
(Please tells us what the JavaScript does e.g. "click on the green button and it does the following...")

When you click on the toggle button on the top left, it switches the class of colors used for the webpage toggling between a light-mode set of colors and dark-mode set of colors by adding removing the dark-mode class.
